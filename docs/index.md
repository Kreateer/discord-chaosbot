## About This Website

This website's function is to essentially be an organized and fancier version
of a wiki for ChaosBot.
It will also allow me to experiment and fiddle around with GitHub Pages, so
it works out for everyone.

If you found this page and are here just to browse out of boredom, I suggest
you scroll through Reddit instead as you might find more interesting
stuff there.

On the other hand, if you wish to make use of my bot, you're welcome to clone
the repository and edit whatever you need to make your own bot.

## About ChaosBot

The bot is meant to be a fun chat bot that allows users to search for and
provide Warhammer 40k content.
Right now it serves little purpose but to keep you entertained and is
currently being used in a few Discord servers (guilds) for testing.

## Project Goals

My goals for this project are fairly simple:

* Allow users to search for images from Reddit and Google Images
* Allow users to play themed games with the bot based on the Warhammer
40k fantasy universe
* Allow users to search for Warhammer 40k lore
* with more to come...

## Functionalities

*NOTE: This list will be updated as new features are developed*

As of **2020/28/08**, this bot can:

* Pull and embed images from Reddit
* Let users self-assign a role
* Print out a list of general and role-specific commands

## Packages

This bot is written in Python 3.7 and is currently using the following packages:

* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html "Discord.py API Documentation")
* [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html "PRAW Documentation")
