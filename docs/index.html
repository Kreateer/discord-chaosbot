<h2 id="about-this-website">About This Website</h2>
<p>This website's function is to essentially be an organized and fancier version<br />of a wiki for ChaosBot.<br />It will also allow me to experiment and fiddle around with GitHub Pages, so<br />it works out for everyone.</p>
<p>If you found this page and are here just to browse out of boredom, I suggest<br />you scroll through Reddit instead as you might find more interesting<br />stuff there.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you wish to make use of my bot, you're welcome to clone<br />the repository and edit whatever you need to make your own bot.</p>
<h2 id="about-chaosbot">About ChaosBot</h2>
<p>The bot is meant to be a fun chat bot that allows users to search for and<br />provide Warhammer 40k content.<br />Right now it serves little purpose but to keep you entertained and is<br />currently being used in a few Discord servers (guilds) for testing.</p>
<h2 id="project-goals">Project Goals</h2>
<p>My goals for this project are fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow users to search for images from Reddit and Google Images<br /></li>
<li>Allow users to play themed games with the bot based on the Warhammer<br />40k fantasy universe<br /></li>
<li>Allow users to search for Warhammer 40k lore<br /></li>
<li>with more to come...</li>
</ul>
