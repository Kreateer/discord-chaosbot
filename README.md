# ChaosBot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Kreateer/discord-chaosbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Kreateer/discord-chaosbot)

**This is a personal (hobby) project as part of my quest to broaden my knowledge of Python and make some friends happy ^^**

The bot is meant to be a fun chat bot that serves little purpose but to keep you entertained :)

Therefore, my *current* goals for this project are as follows:

* Allow users to search for images from Reddit and Google Images
* Allow users to play themed games with the bot based on the Warhammer 40k fantasy universe
* Allow users to search for Warhammer 40k lore

## Functionalities

*NOTE: This list will be updated as new features are developed*

As of **2020/28/08**, this bot can:

* Pull and embed images from Reddit
* Let users self-assign a role
* Print out a list of general and role-specific commands

## Packages

This bot is written in Python 3.7 and is currently using the following packages:

* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html "Discord.py API Documentation")
* [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html "PRAW Documentation")
